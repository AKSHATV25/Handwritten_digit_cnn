Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The app is built with Streamlit so you can interactively draw or upload digits for prediction.

Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of:

60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0â€“9).

Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale.

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy

Epochs: 10

Validation Split: 20%

Results: ~98% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset.

How to Run the Streamlit App

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AKSHATV25/Handwritten_digit_cnn.git
cd Handwritten_digit_cnn


Set up a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
# Activate it:
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure the model file is present:
digit_model.h5 must be in the same folder as app.py.

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py


Open the URL shown in your browser to draw or upload digits for prediction.

Notes

Large files like digit_model.h5 may not display in GitHub but are included in the repository.

.gitignore is used to ignore the venv folder and other unnecessary files.
